npm install

# Run the bot

## Developer Diary

### Scope
* Only support Public GitHub repos.
* Only support one CI platform: `CircleCI`, but will keep in mind how to make it such that more CI platforms could be supported.
  * `CircleCI` due to my personal familiarity with it. It's easy to integrate with public GitHub repos. Its API to read build status seems simple.
* Only support one test runner:  `Jest`
  * `Jest` due to it being the most popular test runner in the latest [stateofjs](https://2018.stateofjs.com/testing/jest/) survey.
  
### Design 
* Decided to use `create-probot-app` as my starting point. 
  * Upon reading the documentation, its core value is:
      * A framework to build a GitHub client/app and thus abstracting away boilerplate/configuration to interact with GitHub API.
      * `create-probot-app` will scaffold my project for my starting point.
  * Pros
    * This should lay the groundwork for relaying CI logs/status to a GitHub PR.
    * Therefore, this should save me some development time/effort. 
  * Cons
    * I don't learn the basics of GitHub API / client application setup. But I can read the source code of Probot to learn more. At its core, it appears to be [a web server](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks) that can receive [webhooks](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks).
 * Identify relevant GitHub Webhooks to consider handling
   * [`status`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#statusevent) - If a public repo is properly integrated with CircleCI, upon a failed build, this webhook should be triggered. We'll want to handle specifically the `failure` status state.

### Order of Operations
* Ensure a repo is integrated with CircleCI and installed this GitHub App.
* Create a PR for this repo.
* This should trigger a CircleCI build for the latest commit in the PR.
* When CircleCI build fails:
  * Triggers GitHub `status` webhook with `failure` state.
    * Probot handles this, and fetches CircleCI API for associated build's information to display to user
    * Format a user friendly / actionable comment to describe why build failed.
    * Post a comment to the PR with this formatted content.
