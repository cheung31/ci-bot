> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that reports failed CI builds for its associated Pull Request. Enable contributors to idenitfy the cause of broken builds quickly, so they can ship quickly.

## Setup
### Run bot locally
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

### Install a new GitHub app
* Navigate to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
* There should be a link to "Register GitHub App".

### Configuring your new GitHub app
Configure:
* General App Settings ([`https://github.com/settings/apps/YOUR-APP`](https://github.com/settings/apps/YOUR-APP))
  * Give your app a name/description
  * Ensure your `.env` variables match the Webhook URL / Secret. (Should already be set properly)
* Permissions ([https://github.com/settings/apps/YOUR-APP/permissions](https://github.com/settings/apps/YOUR-APP/permissions))
  * Ensure following Repository Permissions enabled:
    * `Commit statuses`: Read & write
  * Ensure following Events subscribed:
    * `Status`
    
 ### Add your public repo to CircleCI
 * Follow quick start guide: https://circleci.com/docs/enterprise/quick-start/
 * This will ensure that `status` events/webhooks are triggered when CircleCI builds fail
 
### Simulate an event
* Once you can cause a failed CircleCI build, your GitHub app will track all delivered events: [https://github.com/settings/apps/YOUR-APP/advanced](https://github.com/settings/apps/YOUR-APP/advanced)
* You can `Redeliver` a particular event to simulate it and manually test your application end-to-end 


## Developer Diary
Some notes of how I approached building this, from design decisions to friction points during the implementation.

### Scope
* Only support Public GitHub repos.
* Only support one CI platform: `CircleCI`, but will keep in mind how to make it such that more CI platforms could be supported.
  * `CircleCI` due to my personal familiarity with it. It's easy to integrate with public GitHub repos. Its API to read build status seems simple.
* Only support one test runner:  `Jest`
  * `Jest` due to it being the most popular test runner in the latest [stateofjs](https://2018.stateofjs.com/testing/jest/) survey.
  
### Design 
* Decided to use `create-probot-app` as my starting point. 
  * Upon reading the documentation, its core value is:
      * A framework to build a GitHub client/app and thus abstracting away boilerplate/configuration to interact with GitHub API.
      * `create-probot-app` will scaffold my project for my starting point.
  * Pros
    * This should lay the groundwork for relaying CI logs/status to a GitHub PR.
    * Therefore, this should save me some development time/effort. 
  * Cons
    * I don't learn the basics of GitHub API / client application setup. But I can read the source code of Probot to learn more. At its core, it appears to be [a web server](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks) that can receive [webhooks](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks).
 * Identify relevant GitHub Webhooks to consider handling
   * [`status`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#statusevent) - If a public repo is properly integrated with CircleCI, upon a failed build, this webhook should be triggered. We'll want to handle specifically the `failure` status state.
 * User Experience
   * Make the bot messages as fun/delightful as a failed build can be. Use emojis.
   * Explain that contributors should fix the broken build before proceeding with merge.
   * Identify relevant pieces of build info so someone can action upon it without navigating to CircleCI
     * Failed step, Failed timestamp, Author of failed commit, Log

### Order of Operations
* Ensure a repo is integrated with CircleCI and installed this GitHub App.
* Create a PR for this repo.
* This should trigger a CircleCI build for the latest commit in the PR.
* When CircleCI build fails:
  * Triggers GitHub `status` webhook with `failure` state.
    * Probot handles this, and fetches CircleCI API for associated build's information to display to user
    * Format a user friendly / actionable comment to describe why build failed.
    * Post a comment to the PR with this formatted content.
    
### Struggles
* Building a mental model of end-to-end event --> webhook --> (smee.io proxy)? --> probot flow
  * Required a lot of reading where in those documentations, there's an assumption folks are familiar with GitHub events/webhooks.
  * Perhaps some high-level visual diagram would help developers
* Configuring a GitHub App's Permissions & Events.
  * Was extremely confused why `status` events weren't received
  * [After reading a blog](https://medium.com/@ashantha.lahiru/automate-your-github-workflows-with-probot-960448ec8d77), realized I forgot to enable proper permissions to this app during app creation.
    * Maybe add a section in the [Probot - Configuring a GitHubApp](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) docs explaining permissions/events.
  * Because I changed required permissions to the app *after* installation, I then forgot to accept the updated permissions to this app integration on my test repo.
* Writing unit tests for the probot can be complicated.
  * Perhaps scaffold the project with unit tests that mock out the `app.auth` method returning a GitHub client. I had to read the source code of Probit to realize how this method provided a GitHub client object and later assigned to `context`.
* General thoughts
  * As a Probot developer who is attempting to integrate GitHub webhooks with the Probot framework, friction came from:
    * Finding documentation about GitHub events, Octokit, and Probot docs/internals.
    * Need to find a way to streamline this if possible.
  * Otherwise the scaffolding tool was a great help. As well as the re-deliver events functionality for testing.
